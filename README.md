# Analysis-of-Terrorist-Attack

Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel).The threat of terrorism has become a worldwide concern with several parts of the world reeling under frequent terrorist strikes. With little concern for human lives, terrorists continue to strike with impunity, leaving a trail of death and destruction, wherever they choose to inflict their blows.

My main goal is to conduct an analysis using **GTD** and show what the consequences will be after terrorist attacks, to find the most famous groups, what was the harm to people, to find the most affected countries, etc.
